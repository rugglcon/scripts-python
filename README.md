# scripts-python
A port of my scripts over to python from bash to make them more portable

The original ones can be found at [rugglcon/scripts](https://github.com/rugglcon/scripts) for now, and will stay there for historical purposes.

## Reason
The reason I'm doing this is because python is completely portable across Unix, whereas bash is not. Also if for some reason I was to someday change what shell I wanted to use, I could still use the scripts written in python.
